## **Technology Used**

[TSGL](https://github.com/Calvin-CS/TSGL): A thread-safe graphics library perfect for drawing graphics. You can do a wide variety of things with TSGL, including: image manipulation and rendering (.bmp, .jpeg, and .png image formats supported), 2D polygon drawing (rectangles, circles, triangles, etc.), text rendering, animations with keyboard and/or mouse events, and much more. All drawing and rendering is done with threads and in parallel.

[TSAL](https://github.com/Calvin-CS/TSAL): A thread safe audio library that uses audiolizations to assist in the understanding of concurrent and parallel processing.

+ The goal of my senior design project has been to create a library that joins together the functionality of two other c++ libraries that have been created by Calvin Students over the years. Those two libraries being TSGL (Thread Safe Graphics Library) and TSAL (Thread Safe Audio Library). The purpose of this wasnâ€™t only to make a higher level general purpose library that combines the functionality of both libraries, but also to create and explore some pedagogical tools to potentially help computer science students to understand various sorting algorithms through visualizations and audializations.  My Audio Visual library serves to give others the ability to create programs that utilize both the visual elements of TSGL combined with audio. The other main goal that the library fulfills is allowing audialization, visualization, or a combination of the two to be played.
